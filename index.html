      <p>The course will run from the Friday night (arrival and visit to the local pub) to 5pm on the Sunday. The cost of the course will be £30 plus £73 bed and breakfast (for the first eight bookings). Lunches and dinner paid individually. A non-refundable deposit of £20 will be required to secure a place. The course will be run with a minimum of eight participants and maximum of twelve. Ten standard rooms have been reserved in Elmham House (£36.50 per night), from 17-19 July. If more or other rooms are required, they will need booking independently.</p>
      <p>Topics covered in the course are likely to include (among others): The principle of proportionate causality, applied to evolution and procreation; A metaphysical view of the contraceptive act; The problem of universals. Topics will be lead by Sebastian Morello and Dominic Jones, who are both pursuing doctorates in philosophy and both studied under the late Sir Roger Scruton for their Master's degrees.</p>
